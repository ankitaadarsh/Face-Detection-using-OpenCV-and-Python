# Face Detection using OpenCV and Python
 Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data.  OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. In this project i have used face classifiers of OpenCV to detect faces.
